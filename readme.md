Main Strain is an angular application built to enable cannabis users to submit a form
which in turn will provide a sorted or randomly shuffled list of strain reccomendations which offer the top support/experience/outcome depending on the available options and submitted information. 

A user will be able to read, create, update and delete a strain reccomendation.
