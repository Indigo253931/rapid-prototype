Wireframes:

Main Strain is an application built to enable cannabis users to submit a form
which in turn will provide a sorted or randomly shuffled list of strain reccomendations which offer the top support/experience/outcome depending on the available options and submitted information. 

A user will be able to read, create, update and delete a strain reccomendation.


Workflow:

Use npm to require express:
	
	Initialize node in directory with 'npm init -y'.

	Install express with 'npm install --save express'.

	Package.json will track project associated dependencies and metadata.
	
	Add 'node_modules' to .gitignore file so it is not tracked by git.
